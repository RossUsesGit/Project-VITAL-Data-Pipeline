# Project VITAL Data Pipeline

## Overview
The **Project VITAL Data Pipeline** repository contains all the scripts, processed data spreadsheets, and documentation associated with **Project Vital (Vitality, Infrastructure, Temperature, Air, and Livability)**. This pipeline was developed to support the **multi-dimensional assessment of urban resilience and environmental livability** at the city scale.

**Note:** No original datasets owned by organizations (NASA, Copernicus, WHO, etc.) are included in this repository. To access the raw datasets, please refer to the **documentation PDF**, which provides the sources for obtaining them at the **REFERENCES** section.

## Usage

1. **Check the documentation PDF** (`docs/Project VITAL - A Multi-Dimensional Hybrid Scale Framework for Urban Resilience.pdf`) for details on **Project VITAL's** methodology, justifications, ideology, references, and data sources.
2. Use the Python scripts in `scripts/` to reproduce processed metrics from the raw datasets.
3. Refer to the `data/` folder for outputs, including combined scores for multiple cities.

**Important:** Acquisition of actual data sets and data are within personal effort. The repository only includes **processed derivatives and outputs**.
